# Taskship

What if people actually looked at your ship and gave you appropriate jobs? What if you could turn a profit using your old Flivver for hauling joyriders up to orbit, or join mock battles in your Osprey to thrill the galaxy's dedicated 31st-century-television-equivalent-viewers?

Well, now you can.

I first published Taskship in 2023 as a zip. Then I put it on GitHub. And now, after almost three years of dust collection, I've finally gotten around to polishing this plugin up and working toward a release version (which, since I've already released this plugin twice, will be version 3.0.0).

## Ships Covered So Far

Here's a handy guide to ships I've covered so far, in rough order of priority. If you have any ideas for jobs, feel free to suggest them!

- [x] Human ships (I think? Could have missed some newer ones)
- [ ] Hai ships
- [ ] Coalition ships
- [ ] Korath ships
- [ ] Remnant ships
- [ ] Gegno ships
- [ ] Bunrodea ships
- [ ] Successor ships
- [ ] Avgi ships
- [ ] Incipias ships
- [ ] Other ships I've forgotten exist
- [ ] Blended Ships
- [ ] Ships from other big ship-focused plugins

## Ships I'm Not Including

Part of the point of this plugin originally was to try to sort of soft-balance ships of different classes and make it more appealing to play in smaller ships. For this reason, I'm going to stick with the original guidelines I set forth.

In short, I don't plan on including jobs for any ship that:
- has more than 500 cargo space
- is classified as a Heavy Warship or Superheavy
- is not pilotable by default
- doesn't have a hyperdrive (unless I change my mind on this later)
- is a derivative form of another ship, such as a Scrapper, Modified Argosy, or so forth
- is one of the three starter ships
- is a unique ship that can't be obtained in bulk
